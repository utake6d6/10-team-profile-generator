// The application must have these classes: Employee, Manager, Engineer, and Intern. The tests for these classes (in the _tests_ directory) must all pass.

// The other three classes will extend Employee.

// In addition to Employee's properties and methods, Engineer will also have:

//added properties:
// github          // GitHub username

// added methods:
// getGithub()
// getRole()      // Overridden to return 'Engineer'
